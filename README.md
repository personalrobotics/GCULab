# GCULab

## Overview

**GCU Lab** - Additions to IsaacLab Core functionality for Pack task.

**Pack Task** - Packing environment.

---

### Key Features

#### Heuristic-scoring based search packing agent
Packing agent based on *"Stable bin packing of non-convex 3D objects with a robot manipulator"* by Fan Wang and Kris Hauser.
[arXiv:1812.04093](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04093)

Notes: Uses multiprocessing for placement calculation, recommended `--num_envs 100`
Defaults to DBLF heuristic

**Command:**
```bash
python scripts/fanwang_bpp/fanwang_bpp_agent.py --task=Isaac-Pack-NoArm-v0 --num_envs 100
```

#### Pack Task
Demo for Amazon Packing Task

**Command:**
```bash
python scripts/test_placement_agent.py --task=Isaac-Pack-NoArm-v0 --num_envs 5
```

---

#### IK Reachability Analysis
Requires **curobo** ([Installation Instructions](https://curobo.org/get_started/1_install_instructions.html)).

**Command:**
```bash
python scripts/ik_reachability_agent.py --task=Isaac-Pack-UR5-v0 --num_envs 1
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Isaac Lab
Follow the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
We recommend using the **conda installation** as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

### Step 2: Clone or Copy This Repository
Ensure this project/repository is separate from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e., outside the `IsaacLab` directory).

### Step 3: Install the Library in Editable Mode
Using a Python interpreter with Isaac Lab installed, run:
```bash
# Use 'PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
python -m pip install -e source/tote_consolidation
python -m pip install -e source/gculab
python -m pip install -e source/gculab_assets
```

## Running Tasks with Dummy Agents

These include dummy agents that output zero or random actions. They are useful for verifying environment configurations.

### Zero-Action Agent
**Command:**
```bash
# Use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
python scripts/zero_agent.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
```

---

### Random-Action Agent
**Command:**
```bash
# Use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
python scripts/random_agent.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
```

---

### Test Placement Agent
**Command:**
```bash
# Use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
python scripts/test_placement_agent.py --task=Isaac-Pack-NoArm-v0 --num_envs 5
```

---

## Teleoperation and Imitation Learning
**Command:**
```bash
python scripts/teleop_se3_agent.py --task Isaac-Pack-UR5-Teleop-v0 --num_envs 1 --teleop_device mello
```
### Teleop Device
**Mello** is a teleoperation device designed for intuitive robot control, similar in concept to Gello. It mimics the robot's joint structure, allowing users to control the robot by physically moving the device. Joint positions are sent directly to the robot, eliminating the need for inverse kinematics or physics-based computation. Mello is especially useful for imitation learning, where human demonstrations collected via teleoperation are used to train models. Because Mello closely matches the robotâ€™s kinematics, it enables efficient and accurate data collection for learning from demonstration.

## Code Formatting

We use a **pre-commit template** to automatically format your code.

### Installation
Install pre-commit with:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Running Pre-Commit
Run pre-commit for all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
